Okay, let's break down some thoughts on an IDE for FreeBASIC and Perl, specifically for your "IDEBen4" project.

The core challenge and opportunity here lie in bringing together two languages that aren't typically bundled in a single IDE, especially FreeBASIC which often relies on simpler text editors and command-line compilation.

Here are some thoughts, categorized for clarity:

---

### **1. Core Philosophy & Design Principles**

*   **Lightweight & Fast:** Given that FreeBASIC users often appreciate performance, avoid bloat. The IDE should feel responsive on the Ben4 Desktop.
*   **Highly Configurable:** Both FreeBASIC and Perl developers often have specific preferences. Allow deep customization of syntax highlighting, keybinds, build commands, and external tool integration.
*   **"Batteries Included, but Swappable":** Provide sensible defaults, but let users override almost everything.
*   **Seamless Language Switching:** Make it easy to switch contexts between FreeBASIC and Perl files, or even have a mixed project with both.
*   **Focus on the "Ben4 Desktop" Experience:** If "Ben4 Desktop" has a particular aesthetic or set of core utilities, try to integrate with them.

### **2. Essential Editor Features**

*   **Syntax Highlighting:** Crucial for both FreeBASIC (keywords, operators, strings, comments) and Perl (variables, regex, built-in functions, POD).
*   **Code Completion/IntelliSense (Context-Aware):**
    *   **FreeBASIC:** Suggesting keywords, functions, user-defined types, module procedures/functions.
    *   **Perl:** Suggesting built-in functions, variables (`$`, `@`, `%`), module functions (especially if `use` statements are parsed
